## ESA Swarm services

Swarm is augmented by a number of services aiming to improve accessibility of the data and models derived from the mission.

| [**VirES for Swarm**](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/tools/vires-for-swarm) | Graphical interface to explore the data and models
| [**Swarm Virtual Research Environment (VRE)**](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/tools/swarm-vre) | Cloud-based JupyterLab interface to interact with VirES using Python (see [viresclient](https://viresclient.readthedocs.io/))

[**(Check ESA website for other tools)**](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/swarm)

## Core field

| [**Geodyn**](https://geodyn.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr) | Visualisation of core flows and tools for geomagnetic data assimilation

---

## Ionosphere, aurora, geospace

| [**SuperMAG**](http://supermag.jhuapl.edu/) | Reprocessing and visualisation of variometer data
| [**Swarm-Aurora**](https://swarm-aurora.com/) | Browsing keograms and more
| [**AMPERE**](http://ampere.jhuapl.edu/) | Measurements of FACs using the Iridium constellation
| [**InGeO**](https://ingeo.datatransport.org/)| Providing tools and best practices for geospace research |

## Ground observatory data

For access to and processing of ground observatory data, we refer to the [software list maintained by INTERMAGNET](https://intermagnet.github.io/software.html). Watch this space for new developments (work is in progress to integrate ground data into VirES).
