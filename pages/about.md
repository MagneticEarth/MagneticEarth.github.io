This website is maintained as a voluntary effort and not tied to any particular institution. It is developed with an open source spirit, coordinated through a GitHub organisation - [Magnetic Earth](https://github.com/MagneticEarth).

## Contributing

If you are familiar with GitHub and Jekyll (or even just Markdown), you can make Pull Requests directly with changes to the [content pages](https://github.com/MagneticEarth/MagneticEarth.github.io/tree/master/pages) (we can then test and verify contributions before they go live).
Alternatively, [open an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/MagneticEarth/MagneticEarth.github.io/issues) suggesting changes and to start a discussion - this is probably the best option!
You can also just [email us directly](mailto:ashley.smith@ed.ac.uk) with any text/figures you would like added/changed.
