## Magnetic observatories

The magnetic field [vector components](https://intermagnet.github.io/faq/10.geomagnetic-comp.html) are observed over many years at fixed observatories (some going back to the 19th century) in the global network shown below.
These measurements are also supplemented by variometers (able to measure short time scale changes in the field but without accurate baselines), repeat surveys at some locations, marine and aeromagnetic surveys, and [satellite missions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/missions.md %}).
