## Magnetic observatories and variometers

The magnetic field [vector components](https://intermagnet.github.io/faq/10.geomagnetic-comp.html) are observed over many years at fixed observatories (some going back to the 19th century) around the world.
The [INTERMAGNET organisation](https://intermagnet.github.io) sets standards and provides support to maintain a high quality global network of observatories.
In addition to observatories, variometer stations provide measurements of the *variations* of the magnetic field.
Though such measurements lack the accurate baselines that observatories provide, these data are valuable for monitoring fluctuations such as those due to space weather.
The [SuperMAG collaboration](http://supermag.jhuapl.edu) is a recent initiative to collate and provide access to variometer data in a consistent manner.

## Magnetic surveys

Measurements made at fixed locations are supplemented by a range of targeted surveys made by land, sea, and air.
There are also a number of [satellite missions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/missions.md %}) providing high value data with global coverage.
