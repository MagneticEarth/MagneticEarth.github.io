Experimental deployment of quicklook figures derived from Swarm products (may be slow to load). They show the most recent available data.

Code to generate these figures is in Jupyter notebooks at [GitHub/Swarm-DISC/Swarm_quicklooks](https://github.com/Swarm-DISC/Swarm_quicklooks)

Updated figures are automatically generated daily using [Treebeard](https://treebeard.io)
