# Welcome!

Welcome to the world of geomagnetism!
This website aims to introduce the science of Earth's magnetic field to students and new researchers.
It is currently in the early stages of development - if you are interested in contributing or have any comments, see [About this site]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/about.md %})

## What is geomagnetism?
Geomagnetism is the study of the Earth's magnetic field.
While the vast majority of the Earth's magnetic field resembles a dipole, similar to a bar magnet, we know that the measured magnetic field is a complicated addition of multiple field sources.
These field sources originate from within the Earth's outer core, its crust (where we live!), its atmosphere, magnetosphere, and space.
The magnetic field varies over time in predictable and unpredictable ways, which makes it an interesting area of study and difficult to account for in industry without regular adjustments.

Geomagnetists are scientists who study the Earth's magnetic field processes and data by using computational modelling, measurements from observatories, measurements from satellites, paleomagnetic signatures stored in dated rocks, and lab equipment.
However, almost everyone has measured the magnetic field direction using a compass and utilises the magnetic field in everyday life.  
The first evidence of humans using a compass dates to the 11th Century A.D. (in China) but geomagnetism measurements are relevant to multiple industries other than navigation.
Most mobile phones contain a magnetometer and magnetic field changes have major implications for satellites, processes within the Earth, exploration geophysics, directional drilling, understanding other objects in our solar system, potential hazards to human activity, auroras, and more!

A more detailed introduction to geomagnetism is provided by the [British Geological Survey]({{https://geomag.bgs.ac.uk/education/earthmag.html}}).
This website builds on this explaination by providing introductory explainations for broad subjects (given on the left hand side) with further links to external websites, where resources about geomagnetism can be found.
